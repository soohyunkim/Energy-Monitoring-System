# Energy-Monitoring-System 

Summer internship project at :de: Freie Universität Berlin campus :de:
- Designed real time traffic light displays :vertical_traffic_light:
- Created a real-time chart of the university campus’s total energy consumption by requesting JSON data through SoapUI PHP calls in jQuery using Flot.js library, HTML5, and CSS3 (Check it out [here](http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/uas/ems/flot))! 
- Programmed excel database for six main buildings of the university campus by calculating their monthly energy performance and displayed the results in traffic light interactive displays, bar graphs, and CO2 emission conversion tree diagrams 

The project is currently being implemented by [University Alliance for Sustainability](http://www.fu-berlin.de/en/sites/uas/index.html). The traffic light display and the real-time chart display will be integrated into the university's Content Management System using as iFrames.
